A generic ansible task to compile a binary from a remote source archive

Aims to be generic, robust and idempotent, whilst also ensuring a binary is rebuild if any aspect of the build configuration changes (version, configure line etc)

The task file is platform agnostic, but the examples just happen to target CentOS 7
Do what you want with it, but contributions very welcome
